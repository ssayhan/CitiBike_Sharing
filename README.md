# NYC CITBIKIE ANALYSIS

## Data visualization with Tableau

## Project Overview

We still some more works to convince the investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is solid business proposal. One of the key stakeholders want to see in bike trip analysis.

For the analysis, we will use Pandas to change the “tripduration” column from and integer to datetime datatype. Then, using  the converted datatype, we will create a set of visualization to:

•	Show the length of the time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
•	Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of week.
•	Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week. 

## Background

## Summary

•	Following the analysis, citi-bike is really popular among tourists and locals in NYC

•	Viewing the type of users by day. Chart clearly shows that the majority of gender 1 users are subscribers

•	Usually male users in the morning between 7 a.m. and  9 a.m. and in the evening between 5 p.m. the 7 p.m.. this could be local residents that use the commuting the work.

## Suggestion

•	If we get the weather analysis it would be great for the results. Because weather is effecting directly the bike using. And we can see the data of Citi Bike in different months details.
•	 If we use New York data instead of De Moines it could be gret the collect data. Because New York is big city and more bike friendly roads and or streets. And also New York is business hub and tourist attraction then De Moines
